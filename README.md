# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to identify the staff and their positions that will be affected by the 'Silver Tsunami'...that is the imminently approaching retirement of a large number of employees over a relatively short period of time.

### Results
My results seemed high somehow and didn't match the final retiring_titles table given as the example on the module page. My results for the retiring counts by position were:

- Senior Engineer: 29,414
- Senior Staff: 28,254
- Engineer: 14,222
- Staff: 12,243
- Technique Leader: 4,502
- Assistant Engineer: 1,761
- Manager: 2

I was able to identify 1,549 staff members that would be good candidates for the mentorship program.

### Summary
It looks like Pewlett Hackard is going to need to fill 90,389 roles at some point in the near future, which is an incredibly high number.

Other than managers, it looks like the company is sufficiently staffed at the retirement age level in order to mentor the next generation.
